# NC News

This is my front-end solo project completed during the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) Software Engineering bootcamp. You can see my back-end project that facilitates this app [here](https://github.com/EJC-0305/NC-news-project).

The fully deployed app is available at https://emmas-nc-news.netlify.app/.

The aim of this project is to design and build a web-front for the api previously created in my back-end project which provided access to a database containing mock news stories. The focus being on functionality and accessibility.

During the project I have used React router to create different pages that the user can traverse between, each with their own set of functional components.

Where possible, components have been reused for multiple queries/situations in order to make code more dry.

Moving forward I aim to improve the styling of my app and add additional accessibility features in an effort to create a better user experience.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
